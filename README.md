## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture Highlights

### **Core Systems Built**

#### **Fighter Entity System**
```typescript
// Character-specific stats integration
class Fighter extends Physics.Arcade.Sprite {
    private characterStats: Character["stats"];
    
    // Dynamic stat application
    this.health = this.characterStats.health;
    this.speed = this.characterStats.speed;
    this.jumpVelocity = this.characterStats.jumpVelocity;
}
```

#### **AI Behavior Engine**
```typescript
// Character identification and behavior routing
private updateAI(): void {
    const characterId = this.getCharacterIdFromStats(this.player2.getCharacterStats());
    
    switch (characterId) {
        case "fighter_1": this.updateVeteranBrawlerAI(distance); break;
        case "fighter_2": this.updateSwiftStrikerAI(distance); break;
        // ... unique behavior for each character
    }
}
```

#### **Event-Driven UI Updates**
```typescript
// Clean separation between Phaser and React
EventBus.emit("health-update", {
    player1: { health: this.player1.health, maxHealth: this.player1.maxHealth },
    player2: { health: this.player2.health, maxHealth: this.player2.maxHealth }
});
```

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Fixed 60 FPS Target**: Stable frame rate with optimized physics calculations
- **Efficient Asset Loading**: All 6 characters load simultaneously with shared texture atlases  
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners and physics bodies
- **Collision Optimization**: Precise 50px hurtbox width for consistent combat ranges

## üîß Major Challenges Overcome

### **Challenge 1: Visual Debug Elements Interfering**
**Problem**: Purple debug boxes and green lines cluttering the game view  
**Solution**: Created toggleable FrameDataVisualizer system, disabled by default  
**Outcome**: Clean visual experience while retaining debug capabilities for development

### **Challenge 2: Combat Range and Hit Detection**
**Problem**: Players could attack from unrealistic distances, causing unfair gameplay  
**Solution**: Implemented dual verification system (rectangle intersection + distance checking)  
**Outcome**: Precise combat with 40px light, 60px heavy, 80px special attack ranges

### **Challenge 3: Multiple Hits Per Attack**
**Problem**: Single attacks registering multiple hits, causing instant defeats  
**Solution**: Hit tracking system with unique identifiers per attack frame  
**Outcome**: Each attack can only hit once, creating fair and predictable combat

### **Challenge 4: Match Ending Logic**
**Problem**: Matches continuing past 2 round wins, showing scores like "5-1"  
**Solution**: Fixed `MAX_ROUNDS` configuration and immediate match completion checks  
**Outcome**: Perfect best-of-3 system that ends exactly when first player reaches 2 wins

### **Challenge 5: Character Integration**
**Problem**: AI always used same character regardless of player selection  
**Solution**: Dynamic character selection system excluding player's choice  
**Outcome**: All 6 characters properly integrated with AI using appropriate character stats

### **Challenge 6: Initial Animation Glitches**
**Problem**: Characters showed brief jumping animation at round start  
**Solution**: Set `isGrounded = true` in constructor, added velocity thresholds  
**Outcome**: Clean round starts with characters in proper idle stance

### **Challenge 7: Navigation Freezing**
**Problem**: UI freezing when navigating between scenes multiple times  
**Solution**: Added `removeAllListeners()` calls and proper state reset in scene transitions  
**Outcome**: Smooth navigation between Title ‚Üí Menu ‚Üí Arcade ‚Üí Menu cycles

## üìä What Worked Exceptionally Well

### **‚úÖ Phaser + React Architecture**
- **EventBus Pattern**: Clean separation allowed independent development of game logic and UI
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevented numerous runtime errors and improved development speed
- **Component Reusability**: React components work seamlessly across all game modes

### **‚úÖ Character Stats System**
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new characters by defining stats object
- **Performance Impact**: Each character feels genuinely different without complex code changes
- **AI Integration**: Stats naturally drive AI behavior patterns

### **‚úÖ Animation Framework** 
- **32-Frame Constraint**: Forced creative solutions that actually improved visual variety
- **Shared Structure**: All characters use same animation mapping, simplifying asset pipeline
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new characters following established pattern

### **‚úÖ Combat Balance**
- **Mathematical Precision**: 200 HP √∑ 20 damage = exactly 10 hits creates predictable matches
- **Character Differentiation**: Speed and damage variations create distinct playstyles
- **Round Structure**: 60-second rounds with best-of-3 creates exciting, fast-paced matches

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Didn't Work Initially

### **‚ùå Direct Property Access**
**Problem**: Trying to access `this.player2.characterStats` directly  
**Learning**: Private properties need public getter methods for external access  
**Fix**: Added `getCharacterStats()` public method to Fighter class

### **‚ùå Physics Body Sizing**
**Problem**: Default physics bodies caused players to stick together  
**Learning**: Fighting games need precisely tuned collision boxes  
**Fix**: Fixed 50px hurtbox width with proper offset calculations

### **‚ùå Event Listener Accumulation**
**Problem**: Multiple event listeners being added without cleanup  
**Learning**: Scene transitions require explicit cleanup to prevent conflicts  
**Fix**: `removeAllListeners()` before adding new listeners in scene create()

### **‚ùå Configuration Misalignment**  
**Problem**: `MAX_ROUNDS: 3` but best-of-3 should end at 2 wins  
**Learning**: Game logic configuration must match intended gameplay rules  
**Fix**: Changed to `MAX_ROUNDS: 2` and added immediate completion checks
